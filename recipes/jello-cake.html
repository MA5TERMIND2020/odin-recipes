    <h2>Summer just isn't summer without this cake.</h2>
    <p>I remember trying this cake for the first time in middle school and I absolutely loved it. Iv'e been hooked ever since and I have actually chosen to make this cake for my birthday several times. The Jello gives such a beatiful color and the whipped cream gives a light and fluffy texture. You can easily customize this cake by choosing a different flavor of Jello and adding different fruits like mandarin oranges or even kiwi.</p>
